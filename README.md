# DIYFanNLedController
A software and hardware design for custom modding your PC case with a DIY Fan/LED Contrller

Work is still in progress, there are errors and bugs that are to be dealt with.

This project needs OpenHardwareMonitor to work. This software provides all the information to the VS Software.

The PC App is using .NET Framework 4.5.2 hence it will be able to work on Windows 7 and onwards.

I am in not way affiliated with LTT. Nor am I or anyone who contributes to the software liable for any loss that may be caused due to some error. The contributions will be checked but something might get missed by me or anyone.

Try out the circuit on a breadboard before making it final and test for all shorts. Even though the schematic (to my knowledge) is complete, but there is always room for errors. This is a DIY that you would be putting in your PC. Do it at your own risk, neither me nor anyone who makes changes to the Schematic would be the one to blame.
